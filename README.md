SLO Review
Website: https://sloreview.org/
Contact: charlotte.alexander@sloreview.org
Currently SLO Review takes in articles from contributors in the SLO area regarding social, cultural, professional events and more. Writers manually submit writing that is posted to their website. SLO Review would like a system where individuals can sign up to be a contributor and a login portal where writers can login in order to submit writing. SLO Review would also like a password protected arts scheduling calendar that can be used by different organizations to book their events without conflict and that would notify via mailing list when new events are booked.
